## Roadmap
- [x] Simple CLI (2022-02-01).

- [ ] List windows along with their current position and size.
    - [ ] A refresh button.
    - [ ] Auto refresh, maybe?
- [ ] Add inputs for position and size (and a button to apply).
- [ ] Imitate window operations in the taskbar:
    - [ ] Cascade
    - [ ] Tile
- [ ] Undo functionality for the cascade and tile operations.
- [ ] Add common sizes and aspect ratios for size inputs.
- [ ] Add docking to the sides.
